# jobtracker
a job tracker built in python and tkinter

The purpose of this project was to refresh my skills in python by building a standalone desktop application. Because of this, there are various
functions and functionality that were probably not necessary or efficient for creating the end project. Additionally extraneous code and functions
have been intentionally left in for portability on other projects down the line.

Please note there was a prototype version of the application that ran in the command line interface, while some of the functions
were repurposed for the tkinter GUI you can still run some of the CLI functionality by making jobtracker.py the startup project instead
of jobtrackerGUI.py.
